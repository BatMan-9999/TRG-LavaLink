# What to do if no node is working?
> You can use one of these lavalink servers. There are two types of Lavalink servers - **[SSL](/unofficial-lavalinks/ssl)** and **[NoSSL](/unofficial-lavalinks/nossl)**. SSL is more secure than NoSSL. But NoSSL can be more faster thn SSL Servers. But I recommend using SSL Servers!

>  We also offer you secure severs. If they are getting slow, please mail at **contact@trgop.gq** and let us know, so that we can make more nodes!

# How can I add my Own lavalink server?
> Create a pull request on **ssl.md** or **nossl.md** file. If your lavalink is secure, then create pull request on ssl.md and if not, then nossl.md

> Your details have to be correct for getting it accepted! If we found that details are wrong, then it will get denied!

> You caannot advertise any of your social except your **Portfolio Website**.

> Your link for Portfolio website should be with a **Custom Domain**!

> Advertising any other things will get your request **Denied**!

>  Here is a format for posting the lavalink -

> If you are posting in SSL, then secure will be true and for NoSSL, it will be false

> If your lavalink is not using any SubDomain then just post ur domain (mydomain.com)

> Do not include <> in the format. They ar just shown for help!
